This app is for helping people reach out to their friends and family in their contacts. Using the app, if you give it permission to access your contacts, it will set up a schedule for calling/texting your contacts. Using input from the user, the app will set up a routine for what days, how many people per day, and what time(s) of day a notification will pop up to notify the user it is time to reach out to their person(s) of the day.
